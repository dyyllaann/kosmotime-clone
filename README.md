# KosmoTime Clone
A clone of Nicolas Vandenberghe and Martin Plouy's KosmoTime todo app, written in React. (See the original at <a href="https://www.kosmotime.com">https://www.kosmotime.com</a>)

<h2>Introduction</h2>
This app was originally a todo list project that took visual inspiration from <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/14440819-KosmoTime-Task-Manager">Mik Skuza's KosmoTime design</a>. The original was written in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, with node and Webpack. I decided to progress this project into a more robust clone that is truer to the original KosmoTime app and to refactor my original code using React.
